## About Me 👨‍💻  
I'm a data analyst passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive growth and smarter decisions.  

With a background rooted in curiosity, analysis, and storytelling, I specialize in **Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python** to clean, explore, and visualize data with impact.  

I’ve worked on projects in sales, customer churn, and public safety — each one sharpening my problem-solving skills and love for data.  

Whether I’m building dashboards, exploring trends, or mentoring others, my goal remains the same:  
**Empower with insight. Solve with purpose. Deliver with clarity.**

## 📚 My Data Analytics Projects

### 🔹 [SQL Job Market Project](https://github.com/zararah-malik/SQL_data_analysis_project)  
In this project, I use SQL to analyze job market trends, extracting key insights on demand, skills, and industry patterns to support data-driven career decisions.

### 🔹 [Power BI Supper Store Sales Dashboard Project](https://github.com/zararah-malik/Store-Sales-Dashboard)  
I built this Super Store Sales Dashboard in Power BI to break down sales, profits, and product trends. Cleaned the data in Power Query, then visualized it to spot what’s working and what’s not. It’s simple, clear, and built to help retail decisions feel less like a guess.

### 🔹 [Bank Customer Churn Analysis (PowerBI, Python) Project](https://github.com/zararah-malik/Bank-Churn-Analysis-Python-PowerBI-)  
In this project, I analyzed bank customer churn by cleaning and exploring data in Python, creating insightful visualizations in Power BI, and building a dashboard with actionable recommendations. I segmented customers based on age and behavior to identify trends that drive churn. The project helped me strengthen my data skills.

### 🔹 [Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Excel Project](https://github.com/zararah-malik/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis_MS-Excel)  
The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard gives a clear view of sales trends, customer preferences, and peak business hours. It tracks revenue, best-selling items, and average order value, helping you make smart decisions to manage inventory and boost profits.

### 🔹 [HR (Human Resource) Tableau Project](https://github.com/zararah-malik/HR-Dashboard-Tableau)  
I created an HR analytics dashboard to help managers track hiring trends, demographics, and salary insights. It offers both high-level summaries and detailed employee records, boosting data-driven decision-making.
